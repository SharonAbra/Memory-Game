************* Plan for final project - Sharon Abramovich *************

Create a react memory game to help kids learn English, the game will include three modes:
 - self learning
 - user vs. computer
 - multi-player mode to play with friends in real time

Steps:
1. make a database of words and corresponding images.
2. make a backend to filter data before sending to the front.
3. make the react components (homepage, navbar, container, individual cards, buttons, point accumulation)
4. take care of the routing between different components.
5. make sure the app is responsive for mobile (deploy to heroku for testing?)
6. take care of state management with redux (store, actions, reducers, connecting the components)
7. write the functions to handle different scenarios in the game (win, lose, gain points, go again)
8. style the components with css.

*** if the app is working properly, continue to additional features:

9. write a function for game vs computer.
10. add a library for multiplayer mode, and add functionality for several players.
11. add a chat option - find a teacher.
12. make sure to take care of exceptions.
13. add sign-up and login components.
14 add additional categories?
15. add sounds?
